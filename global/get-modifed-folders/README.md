# üìÅ Get Modified Directory and Sparse Checkout

This GitHub Actions workflow retrieves all modified directories and performs a sparse checkout. It is useful for situations where you want to download only specific parts of a repository based on recent changes.

## Description

The workflow:
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Retrieves modified paths based on include/exclude criteria.
3. Determines if a static analysis should be run and sets the `dir_changes_detected` environment variable.
4. Downloads only the modified folders using git's sparse checkout functionality.

## Inputs

- `start_folder` (Optional): Starting index for path filtering. Default: `'/'`.
- `include_patterns` (Required): Patterns to include in path filtering. Example:
  ```yaml
  "src,domains"
  ```
- `exclude_ignored` (Optional): Whether to exclude ignored paths. Example:
  ```yaml
  ".github,.devops,.vscode,.utils"
  ```
- √¨nclude_folders` (Optional): Folders to include in path filtering. Default: `'scripts,.utils'` Example:
  ```yaml
  ".scripts,.utils"
  ```
  
- stopper_folders:` (Required) Pattern to stop at directory before the configured parameter. Example:` "env" will stop at any folder named "env"'
  ```yaml
    default: "env"
  ```
  
- include_folders:`(Optional) Folders to include in the sparse checkout`
  ```yaml
    default: "scripts,.utils"
  ```
  
- scan_suffix: `(Optional) File suffixes to scan for dependencies`
  ```yaml
   default: ".tf,.tfvars"
  ```

## Outputs

- `modified_paths`: List of modified paths obtained.
- `dir_changes_detected`: Determines if static analysis should run.

## Example Usage

```yaml
      - name: üî® Get Modified Paths
        id: get-paths
        uses: pagopa/eng-github-actions-iac-template/global/get-modifed-folders@main
        with:
          ignore_patterns: ".github,.devops,.vscode,.terraform-version"
          start_folder: "src"
          include_patterns: "src,domains"
          stopper_folders: "env,tests,api,api_product,helm"
```

## Notes

- The file uses Python to perform the main operations of filtering and determining modified paths.
- If the modified paths match the patterns defined in `include_patterns`, the workflow will execute a static analysis and download only the modified directories.
